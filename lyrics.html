        <h2 class="title">LOVE ME LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW
      </h2 class="lyrics">
        You had to kill the conversation
        You always had the upper hand
        Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
        You had to go and ruin all our plans
        Packed your bags and you're leaving home
        Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
        But we have one more day together
        So, love me like there's no tomorrow
        Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
        This is our last goodbye
        And very soon it will be over
        But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
        I guess we drift alone in separate ways
        I don't have all that far to go
        God knows I've learnt to play the lonely man
        I've never felt so low in all my life
        We were born to be just losers
        So, I guess there's a limit on how far we go
        But we only have one more day together
        So, love me like there's no tomorrow
        Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
        This is our last goodbye
        And very soon it will be over
        But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
        Tomorrow
        God knows just where I'll be
        Tomorrow
        Who knows just what's in store for me
        Anything can happen
        But we only have one more day together, yeah
        Just one more day forever
        So, love me like there's no tomorrow
        Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
        This is our last goodbye
        And very soon it will be over
        But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
        So, love me like there's no tomorrow
        Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
        This is our last goodbye
        And very soon it will be over
        But today just love me like there's no tomorrow</pre>
